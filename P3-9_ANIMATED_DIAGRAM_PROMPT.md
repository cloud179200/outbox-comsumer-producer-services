## 🏗️ System Architecture to Animate

### Infrastructure Components (Base Layer)
```
🐘 PostgreSQL Database (Port 5432)
├── Shared database for all services
├── Contains outbox tables, topic registrations, and consumer tracking
└── Handles ACID transactions for reliable message storage

🐙 Apache Kafka (Port 9092) + Zookeeper (Port 2181)
├── Message broker with 6 partitions
├── Topic: "shared-events"
└── Handles message distribution to consumer groups

🌐 Monitoring Tools
├── Kafka UI (Port 8080) - Real-time message monitoring
└── pgAdmin (Port 8082) - Database administration
```

### Service Architecture (Horizontal Scaling)
```
🏭 Producer Services (3 Instances)
├── Producer 1 (localhost:5301) - Container: outbox-producer1
├── Producer 2 (localhost:5302) - Container: outbox-producer2
└── Producer 3 (localhost:5303) - Container: outbox-producer3

🏪 Consumer Services (6 Instances)
├── Group A (3 consumers) - High-load processing
│   ├── Consumer 1 (localhost:5401) - Container: outbox-consumer1
│   ├── Consumer 2 (localhost:5402) - Container: outbox-consumer2
│   └── Consumer 3 (localhost:5403) - Container: outbox-consumer3
├── Group B (2 consumers) - Medium-load processing
│   ├── Consumer 4 (localhost:5404) - Container: outbox-consumer4
│   └── Consumer 5 (localhost:5405) - Container: outbox-consumer5
└── Group C (1 consumer) - Low-load processing
    └── Consumer 6 (localhost:5406) - Container: outbox-consumer6
```

## 🎯 Animation Sequence (Step-by-Step Flow)

### Phase 1: System Initialization
**Duration: 3-5 seconds**
1. **Docker containers** start up in sequence
2. **PostgreSQL** initializes with database schema
3. **Kafka** and **Zookeeper** establish message broker
4. **Service registration** - All producers and consumers register with the system
5. **Health checks** - Green checkmarks appear on all services

### Phase 2: Message Publication Flow
**Duration: 8-10 seconds**

#### Step 1: Client Request (1-2 seconds)
```
External Client → HTTP POST → Producer Service API
Request: {
  "topic": "user-events",
  "message": "User john.doe@example.com created account",
  "useBatching": true
}
```
- Show HTTP request arrow with JSON payload
- Highlight which producer receives the request

#### Step 2: Message Batching Decision (1 second)
```
Producer API → Batching Service Decision
├── If useBatching = true → Queue for batch processing
└── If useBatching = false → Process immediately
```
- Show branching logic with visual decision diamond
- For batch: Messages accumulate in queue (show counter: 1, 2, 3... up to 500)

#### Step 3: Outbox Storage (2-3 seconds)
```
Batching Service → PostgreSQL Transaction
├── Create OutboxMessage record with PENDING status
├── Resolve topic registration to find consumer groups
└── Create message copies for each consumer group (group-a, group-b, group-c)
```
- Show database transaction with ACID guarantee
- Animate records being inserted into OutboxMessages table
- Show message replication for each consumer group

#### Step 4: Background Job Processing (2-3 seconds)
```
Quartz.NET Jobs (Every 30 seconds)
├── MessageBatchingJob → Flush pending batches
└── ProcessPendingMessagesJob → Send to Kafka
```
- Show job scheduler timer countdown
- Animate batch processing with progress bar
- Update message status: PENDING → SENT

### Phase 3: Kafka Message Distribution (3-4 seconds)
```
Producer Service → Kafka Producer → Kafka Topic
├── Message payload with headers (MessageId, ConsumerGroup, ProducerServiceId)
├── Idempotency key and retry information
└── Distribution across 6 Kafka partitions
```
- Show message serialization and header attachment
- Animate message distribution across Kafka partitions
- Visual representation of message replication

### Phase 4: Consumer Processing (5-7 seconds)

#### Step 1: Message Consumption (2 seconds)
```
Kafka Topic → Consumer Services (Polling every 5 seconds)
├── Group A consumers (3 instances) poll messages
├── Group B consumers (2 instances) poll messages
└── Group C consumer (1 instance) polls messages
```
- Show polling mechanism with timer
- Animate message delivery to each consumer group
- Highlight parallel processing across groups

#### Step 2: Idempotency Check (1-2 seconds)
```
Consumer Service → PostgreSQL ProcessedMessage Table
├── Check if MessageId + ConsumerGroup already exists
├── If exists → Skip processing (show duplicate prevention)
└── If new → Continue to processing
```
- Show database lookup with visual query
- Animate duplicate detection logic

#### Step 3: Business Logic Processing (2-3 seconds)
```
Consumer Service → Custom Message Processor
├── Parse message content
├── Execute business logic based on topic
└── Return success/failure result
```
- Show message processing with progress indicator
- Animate success/failure outcomes with different colors

### Phase 5: Acknowledgment Flow (4-5 seconds)

#### Step 1: Consumer Acknowledgment (2 seconds)
```
Consumer Service → Producer Service HTTP Call
POST /api/messages/acknowledge
{
  "messageId": "abc123",
  "consumerGroup": "group-a",
  "success": true
}
```
- Show HTTP acknowledgment with success/failure status
- Animate acknowledgment traveling back to producer

#### Step 2: Outbox Status Update (1-2 seconds)
```
Producer Service → PostgreSQL OutboxMessage Update
├── Status: SENT → ACKNOWLEDGED (success)
└── Status: SENT → FAILED (failure)
```
- Show database update with status change animation
- Track acknowledgment timestamp

#### Step 3: Tracking and Monitoring (1-2 seconds)
```
Update Consumer Tracking Tables
├── ProcessedMessage → Record successful processing
└── FailedMessage → Record failure with error details
```
- Show tracking table updates
- Display real-time counters for processed/failed messages

### Phase 6: Retry and Recovery Mechanism (6-8 seconds)

#### Step 1: Failure Detection (2 seconds)
```
ProcessRetryMessagesJob (Every 10 seconds)
├── Scan for unacknowledged messages past timeout
├── Check acknowledgment timeout (default: 30 minutes)
└── Identify messages needing retry
```
- Show job timer and scanning process
- Highlight messages that need retry (red color)

#### Step 2: Retry Strategy (2-3 seconds)
```
Retry Logic Decision
├── Check MaxRetries configuration
├── If MaxRetries = -1 → Infinite retry (show ∞ symbol)
├── If MaxRetries > 0 → Limited retry with counter
└── Apply exponential backoff delay
```
- Show retry counter incrementing
- Animate backoff delay with timer

#### Step 3: Targeted Retry (2-3 seconds)
```
Create Retry Message
├── Mark as IsRetry = true
├── Set TargetConsumerServiceId (if specified)
├── Copy original message with retry metadata
└── Republish to Kafka topic
```
- Show retry message creation with special marking
- Animate targeted delivery to specific consumer

### Phase 7: System Monitoring and Health (3-4 seconds)

#### Step 1: Health Monitoring (1-2 seconds)
```
Agent Management System
├── Producer heartbeats (every 30 seconds)
├── Consumer heartbeats (every 30 seconds)
└── Service health checks
```
- Show heartbeat signals from all services
- Display health status dashboard

#### Step 2: Real-time Monitoring (1-2 seconds)
```
Monitoring Endpoints
├── Kafka UI → Topic and partition monitoring
├── Producer APIs → Message status tracking
└── Consumer APIs → Processing statistics
```
- Show monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- Display message flow statistics and performance graphs
