// This file has been reorganized for better maintainability.
// Classes have been moved to individual files:

// Import all core model dependencies
global using ProducerService.Models.Messages;
global using ProducerService.Models.Enums;

namespace ProducerService.Models.Core;

// This file maintains backward compatibility while the codebase is organized.
// Individual classes are now in separate files under:
// - ProducerService.Models.Messages.*
// - ProducerService.Models.Enums.*

// For new development, please use the individual class files directly
// instead of referencing this compatibility file.
